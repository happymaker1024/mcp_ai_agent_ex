This concept can highlight regional flavors and support local producers.\n   - **Target Audience**: Food enthusiasts, tourists, and locals interested in unique culinary experiences. This demographic often values sustainability and local sourcing.\n   - **Competition**: Other cafes and restaurants that focus on local cuisine may pose competition.
